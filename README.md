# CustomDataStructures

### Overview
This repository is full of data structures that are built from scratch in Java for my Data Structures and Algorithms class at Purdue. The goal in building them from scratch is that they are much more efficient than using Java's built-in data structure libraries. My implementations of these data structures pass all test cases.

### Details
Interfaces were provided, data structure classes were built from scratch. Note that many of the data structures have additional methods not stated in the interface, which were added for simplicity in using the data structures to implement solutions in other classes. The format of the repository is as follows:
- src: Contains a class for each data structure, along with their interfaces
- test: Contains jUnit test cases for each data structure
